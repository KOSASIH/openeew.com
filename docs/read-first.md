For those who wish to create their own EEW, we have a few suggestions:

1. **Start small**. It's easy to start thinking you'll create the first national network in Ecuador or Nepal, but protecting just one community is a remarkable achievement (and inexpensive), and you will learn much along the way. In Slack we would be happy to discuss your project with you and offer some advice based on our experiences.
1. **You don't have to build everything**. Do you like tinkering with sensors? then generate data that others can ingest. You prefer to create mobile apps ? why not receive push notifications from existing networks. Join Slack and seek partnerships with like-minded folks.
1. **Not a technical person?** that's fine, you can start with a couple of sensors, a laptop, and a Twitter account for alerts. If our documentation is too difficult to follow, [we'd love to know](https://github.com/grillo/openeew-docs/issues).
