An EEW must strive to be as fast as possible in detecting earthquakes, whilst also making sure that the alerts are accurate. That is to say, non-earthquake events must be filtered out in the detection system.

If users receive only a few false negatives, or false positives, then trust in the EEW will be eroded. Given the stress caused by an EEW alarm, it is important to be as accurate as possible with your alerts, and test the system thoroughly before going public.

A traditional approach to ensuring accuracy is the **multi-station** approach. Here an alert is not sent until triggers have been registered from more than 1 sensor, within a specified distance and time (to ensure all events are related).
