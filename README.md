# OpenEEW Documentation Website

This OpenEEW website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Deployment

```
$ GIT_USER=<username> yarn deploy
```
This command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch with github pages hosting.
